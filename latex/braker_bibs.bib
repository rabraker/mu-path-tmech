abstract={This paper addresses the problem of driving the state of a linear discrete-time system to zero in minimum time. The inputs are constrained to lie in a bounded and convex set. The solution presented in the paper is based on the observation that the state sequence induced by the minimum-time control sequence is the sparsest possible state sequence over a certain finite horizon. That is, the desired state sequence must contain as many zero vectors as possible, all those zeros corresponding to the highest values of the time index. Hence, by taking advantage of some recent developments in sparse optimization theory, we propose a numerical solution. We show in simulation that the proposed method can effectively solve the minimum-time problem even for multi-inputs linear discrete-time systems.},

In this work we explore the use of compressed sensing as a means of sampling data and generating an image. Under this approach only a small number of the pixels in an image, typically as few as 10\%, need to be sampled to generate an accurate image. We show that when combined with time-optimal control to move the tip of the microscope between measurement locations, the imaging time is comparable to high-speed AFM systems while also greatly reducing the interactions with and force applied to the sample. In addition, the approach can significantly reduce the imaging time in applications such as force mapping in which the tip is moved point-by-point through a sequence of measurement locations rather than continuously scanned as in standard imaging.},

    abstract = { Directly observing individual protein molecules in action at high spatiotemporal resolution has long been a holy grail for biological science. This is because we long have had to infer how proteins function from the static snapshots of their structures and dynamic behavior of optical makers attached to the molecules. This limitation has recently been removed to a large extent by the materialization of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). HS-AFM allows us to directly visualize the structure dynamics and dynamic processes of biological molecules in physiological solutions, at subsecond to sub-100-ms temporal resolution, without disturbing their function. In fact, dynamically acting molecules such as myosin V walking on an actin filament and bacteriorhodopsin in response to light are successfully visualized. In this review, we first describe theoretical considerations for the highest possible imaging rate of this new microscope, and then highlight recent imaging studies. Finally, the current limitation and future challenges to explore are described. },

In this study, we tailor and apply a new QP method, called QPSchur, to large MPC applications, such as cross directional control problems in paper machines. Written in C++, QPSchur is an object oriented implementation of a novel dual space, Schur complement algorithm. We compare this approach to three widely applied QP algorithms and show that QPSchur is significantly more efficient (up to two orders of magnitude) than the other algorithms. In addition, detailed simulations are considered that demonstrate the importance of the flexible, object oriented construction of QPSchur, along with additional features for constraint handling, warm starts and partial solution.},

We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

Explicit formulas are given that allow for setting the parameters of the algorithm to obtain a periodic solution with the prescribed characteristics.

Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas–Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for l1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.},

For these systems, achieving minimal settling time is the main concern, while the input cost is usually of less importance. Hence, this paper presents a new type of MPC; time optimal MPC (TOMPC) which minimizes the settling time of the system. Theoretical considerations show that TOMPC is stabilizing. Simulations show the merits of this technique and indicate that it is applicable in real-time.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the performance of a dual-adaptive feedforward control architecture applied to the raster scan of a piezo-based positioning system. In previous work [1], we introduced the adaptive-delay algorithm that improved the tracking performance of the feedforward plant-injection architecture. The key benefit of the adaptive-delay algorithm is the adaptation calculation that does not require knowledge of plant parameters. In [1], the algorithm uses model-inverse-based feedforward control to increase raster-tracking bandwidth. It is well known that model-inverse-based feedforward control designs can perform poorly in the presence of large model variation or uncertainty. System identification methods reveal that the frequency response of our piezoscanner includes a large amount of variation as the user requests various operating points within the stage's range. As a result, tracking performance degrades as we vary from the conditions with which the model was identified. To correct for this, we combined the adaptive-delay algorithm with partial-parameter adaptation that updates critically variant parameters. This partnership of adaptive feedforward controllers improved experimental tracking results and robustness to model uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The proximate time optimal servomechanism (PTOS) is a well established algorithm for the control of linear systems where control bounds and the speed of response are important. The PTOS approach modifies the time-optimal switching curve by including an unsaturated ldquoslabrdquo region that leads to a linear control regime for small errors. The control parameters are required to satisfy the continuity and the stability constraints resulting in only a single independent design parameter. In this note, the PTOS theory is reviewed and the stability conditions are derived. An improved version of the PTOS algorithm, called the MPTOS, is presented that results in a performance improvement over the original PTOS by providing two independent control parameters in the design. As a result, the system response can be shaped in a more efficient way in both continuous and discrete time domains. The stability conditions are derived for the proposed MPTOS scheme for continuous and discrete time implementations. Further extensions are discussed including a new discrete algorithm suitable for systems with slow sampling and a model reference tracking method also known as a feedforward/feedback structure for reducing the response of flexible modes. The latter method can be extended to dual actuator systems as are being introduced to the disk drive read/write head assembly fabrication and control. An approach is also presented for combining the vibration reduction filters with the model reference structure to further enhance the performance.},

The performance of the closed-loop system is analysed through an experimental application to an electromechanical plant to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed second-order sliding mode control and factors involved in the design. The second-order plant parameters are experimentally determined using input–output measured data. The results of the experimental application are presented to make a quantitative comparison with the traditional (first-order) sliding mode control (SMC) and PID control.

To illustrate the validity of the proposed general model, a dynamic backlash-like model is adopted as one of hysteresis models to describe the hysteresis effect, which is confirmed by experimental tests. Thus, the developed model provides a general frame for controller design. As an illustration to this aspect, a robust adaptive controller is developed based on a reduced dynamic model under both unknown hysteresis nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties. The proposed control law ensures the boundedness of the closed-loop signals and desired tracking precision.

  abstract = {This paper proves a novel sampling theorem with constant amplitude and variable width pulses. The theorem states that any bandlimited baseband signal within ±0.637 can be represented by a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform with unit amplitude. The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level. The proof of the sampling theorem uses a simple iterative technique that is guaranteed to converge to the exact PWM representation whenever it exists. The paper goes on to develop a practical matrix based iterative technique to generate the PWM waveform that is guaranteed to converge exponentially. The peak constraint in the theorem is only a sufficient condition. In fact, many signals with higher peaks, e.g., lower than Nyquist frequency sinusoids, can be accurately represented by a PWM waveform.},

The eigensystem realisation algorithm is used to generate a model, and then a curve fit based on the complex log of the transfer functions is used to reduce the model. Finally, the model is fine-tuned using a curve fit to the transfer function data directly. This method has been shown to work well on the SERC Interferometric Testbed, a system with many lightly-damped, closely spaced modes. One facet of identifying a system model from the interferometer data was the absence of noise in the measured transfer functions. Future work will examine performance of this method on noisier data and suggest modifications},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced industrial control technique that relies on the solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem at every sampling instant to determine the input action required to control the current and future behaviour of a physical system. Its ability in handling large multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with physical constraints has led to very successful applications in slow processes, where there is sufficient time for solving the optimization problem between sampling instants. The application of MPC to faster systems, which adds the requirement of greater sampling frequencies, relies on new ways of finding faster solutions to QP problems. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are specially well suited for this application due to the large amount of computation for a small amount of I/O. In addition, unlike a software implementation, an FPGA can provide the precise timing guarantees required for interfacing the controller to the physical system. We present a high-throughput floating-point FPGA implementation that exploits the parallelism inherent in interior-point optimization methods. It is shown that by considering that the QPs come from a control formulation, it is possible to make heavy use of the sparsity in the problem to save computations and reduce memory requirements by 75\%. The implementation yields a 6.5x improvement in latency and a 51x improvement in throughput for large problems over a software implementation running on a general purpose microprocessor.},

We compare the computational complexity, storage, convergence speed, and some practical implementation issues. We find that, in general, ASM gives lower complexity and converges faster when the numbers of decision variables and constraints are small. Otherwise, IPM should be a better choice due to its scalability. We also note occasional instability of both IPM and ASM when they are implemented in our FPGA, which uses single precision floating point arithmetic. The instability is mainly due to numerical error, which is found to be more serious in ASM than IPM in our current implementations.},

To handle the coupled behavior of dynamics and hysteresis, a cascade model is presented to enable the application of inversion-based feedforward control. The dynamics, which include vibration and creep, are modeled using linear transfer functions. A frequency-based method is used to invert the linear model to find an input that compensates for vibration and creep. The inverse is noncausal for nonminimum-phase systems. Similarly, the hysteresis is handled by an inverse-Preisach model. To avoid the complexity of finding the inverse-Preisach model, high- gain feedback control can be used to linearize the system's behavior. A feedforward input is then combined with the feedback system to compensate for the linear dynamics to achieve high-speed AFM imaging. Finally, recent efforts in feedforward control for an SPM application including the use of iteration to handle hysteresis as well as uncertainties and variations in the system model is discussed.},

A parameterized design of expanded PTOS control law with a speed-dependent linear region is presented for rapid and smooth set-point tracking using a bounded input signal. The control scheme uses the time-optimal bang-bang control law to accomplish maximum acceleration or braking whenever appropriate and then smoothly switches into a linear control law to achieve a bumpless settling. The control scheme is then applied to the position-velocity control loop in a permanent magnet synchronous motor servo system for set-point position regulation. Numerical simulation has been conducted, followed by experimental verification based on a TMS320F2812 digital signal controller board. The results confirm that the servo system can track a wide range of target references with superior transient performance and steady-state accuracy.},

  abstract={This work develops a novel sensing matrix for the application of compressed sensing (CS) to image acquisition in atomic force microscopy (AFM), with the goal of improving the temporal resolution of the instrument by reducing the amount of data that needs to be acquired to create a high-quality image. In traditional CS, each measurement is, by design, a linear combination of the elements of the signal under study. In AFM however, the physics of the sensing process require that each measurement contains information about only a single point. The measurement matrix introduced here takes this into account and allows the user to balance image acquisition time against image quality. The proposed method is demonstrated through simulation. These simulations show faithful recovery with a reduction in imaging time on the order of a factor of five. By accepting a reduction in image reconstruction quality, additional gains in imaging time of ten times or more, were achieved.},

  abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a device capable of generating topographic images of sample surfaces with extremely high resolutions down to the atomic level. It is also being used in applications that involve manipulation of matter at a nanoscale. Early AFMs were operated in open loop. As a result, they were susceptible to piezoelectric creep, thermal drift, hysteresis nonlinearity and scan-induced vibration. These effects tend to distort the generated image. The distortions are often minimized by limiting the scanning speed and range of the AFMs. Recently a new generation of AFMs has emerged that utilizes position sensors to measure displacements of the scanner in three dimensions. These AFMs are equipped with feedback loops that work to minimize the adverse effects of hysteresis, piezoelectric creep and thermal drift on the obtained image using standard PI controllers. These feedback controllers are often not designed to deal with the highly resonant nature of an AFM's scanner, nor with the cross-coupling between various axes. In this paper we illustrate the drastic improvement in accuracy and imaging speed that can be obtained by proper design of a feedback controller. Such controllers can be incorporated into most modern AFMs with minimal effort since they can be implemented in software with the existing hardware.},

This paper addresses the compensation of nonlinear effects of creep and hysteresis on the piezo scanners which drive most AFMs. Creep and hysteresis are modeled as the superposition of fundamental operators, and their inverse model is obtained by using the inversion properties of the Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator. Identification of the parameters in the forward model is achieved by a novel method that uses the topography of the sample and does not require position sensors. The identified parameters are used to compute the inverse model, which in turn serves to drive the AFM in an open-loop, feedforward scheme. Experimental results show that this approach effectively reduces the spatial uncertainties associated with creep and hysteresis, and supports automated, computer-controlled manipulation operations that otherwise would fail.},

In the linear model predictive control (MPC) framework, offset-free control is usually achieved by adding step disturbances to the process model. The most widely-used industrial MPC implementations assume a constant output disturbance that can lead to sluggish rejection of disturbances that enter the process elsewhere. This paper presents a general disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output. Conditions that guarantee detectability of the augmented system model are provided, and a steady-state target calculation is constructed to remove the effects of estimated disturbances. Conditions for which offset-free control is possible are stated for the combined estimator, steady-state target calculation, and dynamic controller.

The purpose of these additional disturbances is to lump the plant-model mismatch and/or unmodeled disturbances. Its effectiveness has been proven for particular square cases only. For systems with a number of measured variables (p) greater than the number of manipulated variables (m), it is clear that any controller can track without offset at most m controlled variables. One may think that m integrating disturbances are sufficient to guarantee offset-free control in the m controlled variables. We show this idea is incorrect and present general conditions that allow zero steady-state offset. In particular, a number of integrating disturbances equal to the number of measured variables are shown to be sufficient to guarantee zero offset in the controlled variables. These results apply to square and nonsquare, open-loop stable, integrating and unstable systems.},

The process is entirely computational, and the output load and filter are the only analog components in the system. The process makes use of digital signal processing and a switching power stage to provide both high fidelity and high efficiency, beginning with a digital audio data stream. The advantages of naturally-sampled pulse-width modulation (PWM) are discussed in depth, including spectral analysis and comparisons to uniformly-sampled PWM. It is shown that natural PWM does not introduce audible distortion at switching frequencies consistent with power electronics practice. Interpolation methods for sample data conversion to natural PWM are discussed, and error analysis is presented based on Lagrange's Expansion Theorem. Noise-shaping processes are used to support high fidelity with practical values of time resolution. A counter conversion process enforces switching dead time in the inverter gate signals. The experimental full-bridge inverter implementation demonstrates that miniaturization is possible. A complete test system delivered more than 50 W into an 8 Ω load with an efficiency of 80\% and total harmonic distortion plus noise of 0.02\%.},

Maybe, the most popular alternative approach is the so-called proximate time-optimal servomechanism (PTOS). This approach starts with a near-time-optimal controller and, then, switches to a linear controller when the system output is close to a given target. However, the chattering problem is avoided at the expense of a slower time response. In this paper, two methods for eliminating the conservatism present in the PTOS are proposed. The first method applies a dynamically damped controller that allows the so-called acceleration discount factor to be pushed arbitrarily close to 1. The second method applies a continuous nonlinear control law that makes use of no switching. Experimental results show that the proposed designs practically eliminate the conservatism in the traditional PTOS.},

An improvement over the traditional Proximate Time Optimal Servomechanism (PTOS) is proposed in order to eliminate the conservatism present in the controller. The original PTOS switches from the nonlinear approximation of Time Optimal Control (TOC) to a linear controller as the system approaches the reference point. This switching results in a compromise in performance inasmuch as the linear controller is not sufficiently aggressive to settle the system output with acceptable levels of overshoot. The proposed controller eliminates the necessity of the switching function by making use of an elaborate nonlinear control law.

In real time applications, the model of the systems obtained by empirical technique gives higher order model. In the proposed method, there is no need to use model order reduction technique as the higher order model can be directly used to design the sliding law. The sliding surface is (n−1)th n − order differential equation of error obtained from output and desired reference trajectory, where n is order of the system whose performance has to improve. As per the theory of sliding mode, the total control law is obtained using the proposed method by selecting sliding surface and smooth hyperbolic tangent function. The hyperbolic tangent function is used to reduce chattering phenomenon that occurs in many cases when there are use of sliding mode strategy. The single variable processes with delay time, lower or higher order, monotonic or oscillatory behavior are effectively controlled by the proposed sliding mode algorithm. The Lyapunov function is used to ensure the stability and simulation examples are incorporated to show the effect of proposed method.},

In this paper we demonstrate this experimentally with a MEMS-based probe-storage prototype using a micro-scanner that serves as the positioner for the storage medium. First the theoretically minimum achievable seek times are derived for the micro-scanner by approximating its dynamics with a damped harmonic oscillator model. Then the similarity of the time-optimal solution with that of the better studied double integral system is exploited to employ a proximate-time-optimal controller for the experimental studies. The experimental results demonstrate seek times of approximately 1.6 ms for seek operations of 50 ??m.},

A potential field is generated in the two-dimensional “trajectory space” of the UGV path curvature and longitudinal velocity. Dynamic constraints, terrain conditions, and navigation conditions can be expressed in this space. A maneuver is chosen within a set of performance bounds, based on the potential field gradient. In contrast to traditional potential field methods, the proposed method is subject to local maximum problems, rather than local minimum. It is shown that a simple randomization technique can be employed to address this problem. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully navigate a UGV between pre-defined waypoints at high speed, while avoiding unknown hazards. Further, vehicle velocity and curvature are controlled to avoid rollover and excessive side slip. The method is computationally efficient, and thus suitable for on-board real-time implementation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and control of a high-speed and large-range atomic force microscopy (AFM). A multi-actuation scheme is proposed where several nano-positioners cooperate to achieve the range and speed requirements. A simple data-based control design methodology is presented to effectively operate the AFM scanner components. The proposed controllers compensate for the coupled dynamics and divide the positioning responsibilities between the scanner components. As a result, the multi-actuated scanner behavior is equivalent to that of a single X–Y–Z positioner with large range and high speed. The scanner of the designed AFM is composed of five nano-positioners, features 6 μm out-of-plane and 120 μm lateral ranges and is capable of high-speed operation. The presented AFM has a modular design with laser spot size of 3.5 μm suitable for small cantilever, an optical view of the sample and probe, a conveniently large waterproof sample stage and a 20 MHz data throughput for high resolution image acquisition at high imaging speeds. This AFM is used to visualize etching of calcite in a solution of sulfuric acid. Layer-by-layer dissolution and pit formation along the crystalline lines in a low pH environment is observed in real time.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the classical Preisach hysteresis modeling and tracking control of a curved pre-stressed piezoceramic patch actuator system with severe hysteresis. The actuator is also flexible with very small inherent damping. It has potential applications in active antennas. A series of tests are conducted to study the hysteresis properties of the piezoceramic actuator system. The numerical expressions of the classical Preisach model for different input variations are presented. The classical Preisach model is applied to simulate the static hysteresis behavior of the system. Higher order hysteresis reversal curves predicted by the classical Preisach model are verified experimentally. The good agreement found between the measured and predicted curves showed that the classical Preisach model is an effective mean for modeling the hysteresis of the piezoceramic actuator system. Subsequently, the inverse classical Preisach model is established and applied to cancel the hysteresis the piezoceramic actuator system for the real-time microposition tracking control. In order to improve the control accuracy and to increase damping of the actuator system, a cascaded PD/lead-lag feedback controller is designed with consideration of the dynamics of the actuator. In the experiments, two cases are considered, control with major loop hysteresis compensation, and control with minor loop hysteresis compensation. Experimental results show that RMS tracking errors are reduced by 50\% to 70\% if the hysteresis compensation is added in the feedforward path in both cases. Therefore, hysteresis compensation with the feedback controller greatly improves the tracking control accuracy of the piezoceramic actuator.},

However, AFM obtains the sample topography image through scanning on the top of sample line by line, therefore it takes couples minutes to get an image and this negative point makes it difficult to continuously observe surface change during manipulation. In this paper, a novel approach for compressive sensing based video rate AFM imaging system is proposed. In this method, compressive sensing is used for sampling topography information of sample surface efficiently. Compressive sensing could use fewer measurements for data sensing to recovery the image through image reconstruction algorithm. This technique decreases the scanning time for AFM scanner because of fewer measurements needed. The video rate for this new approach could reach as high as 1.75 seconds per frame.},

State feedback can be used to address this question by creating closed-loop modes which are unobservable at these points, and so do not contribute to the measured response. In the frequency domain, such modes correspond to pole/zero cancellations in the closed loop system. This paper analyzes the problem of pole/zero cancellation in flexible structures, making full use of the second-order form of such systems. An explicit expression is derived for the unique state feedback gain with minimum norm which cancels all open-loop zeros. Furthermore, the properties of the residual poles that remain observable in the closed-loop system are studied, and their stability proven for the case of colocated sensors and actuators.},

The proposed algorithm keeps the closed-loop damping coefficient at a predetermined value. Compared to the original PTOS, smaller damping in deceleration will boost the rising speed, and larger damping in the settling phase reduces the overshoot and residual vibrations. Moreover, the DSPTOS maintains the simplicity of the PTOS by introducing just a predetermined damping coefficient. We applied the proposed DSPTOS algorithm to a voice coil motor in a hard disk drive. Through simulations and real-time experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the DSPTOS. In particular, with respect to long stroke seeks, the DSPTOS performs better than the PTOS.},

The proposed proximate time-optimal digital (PTOD) controller is a combination of a constant-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM) controller employing a linear PID compensator close to a reference point, and a linear or nonlinear switching surface controller (SSC) away from the reference, together with smooth transitions between the two. A hybrid capacitor current estimator enables switching surface evaluation and eliminates the need for current sensing. The SSC, which is implemented as a small Verilog HDL module, can be easily added to an existing digital PWM controller to construct the PTOD controller. In steady state, the controller operates exactly the same as a standard constant-frequency PWM controller with a linear PID compensator. Simulation and experimental results are shown for a 6.5 V-to-1.3 V, 10A synchronous buck converter.},

abstract={Spacecraft, space-borne robotic systems, and manufacturing equipment often utilize lightweight materials and configurations that give rise to vibration problems. Prior research has led to the development of input command preshapers that can significantly reduce residual vibration. These shapers exhibit marked insensitivity to errors in natural frequency estimates and can be combined to minimize vibration at more than one frequency. A method for the development of multiple mode input shapers which are simpler to implement than previous designs and produce smaller system response delays is presented. The new technique involves the solution of a group of simultaneous nonlinear impulse constraint equations. The resulting shapers were tested on a model of MACE, an MIT/NASA experimental flexible structure},

volume={15},

pages={936-944},
abstract={In this brief, the compensation for both the nonlinear hysteresis and the vibrational dynamics effects of piezo actuators is studied. Piezo actuators are the enabling device in many applications such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) to provide nano- to atomic-levels precision positioning. During high-speed, large-range positioning, however, large positioning errors can be generated due to the combined hysteresis and dynamics effects of piezo actuators, making it challenging to achieve precision positioning. The main contribution of this brief is the use of an inversion-based iterative control (IIC) technique to compensate for both the hysteresis and vibrational dynamics effects of piezo actuators. The convergence of the IIC algorithm is investigated by capturing the input-output behavior of piezo actuators with a cascade model consisting of a rate-independent hysteresis at the input followed by the dynamics part of the system. The size of the hysteresis and the vibrational dynamics variations that can be compensated for (by using the IIC method) is quantified. The IIC approach is illustrated through experiments on a piezotube actuator used for positioning on an AFM system. Experimental results show that high-speed, large-range precision positioning can be achieved by using the proposed IIC technique. Furthermore, the proposed IIC algorithm is also applied to experimentally validate the cascade model and the rate-independence of the hysteresis effect of the piezo actuator.},

abstract = {In this article, a second-order sliding mode control (2-SMC) is proposed for second-order uncertain plants using equivalent control approach to improve the performance of control systems. A Proportional + Integral + Derivative (PID) sliding surface is used for the sliding mode. The sliding mode control law is derived using direct Lyapunov stability approach and asymptotic stability is proved theoretically. The performance of the closed-loop system is analysed through an experimental application to an electromechanical plant to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed second-order sliding mode control and factors involved in the design. The second-order plant parameters are experimentally determined using input–output measured data. The results of the experimental application are presented to make a quantitative comparison with the traditional (first-order) sliding mode control (SMC) and \{PID\} control. It is demonstrated that the proposed 2-SMC system improves the performance of the closed-loop system with better tracking specifications in the case of external disturbances, better behavior of the output and faster convergence of the sliding surface while maintaining the stability. },

High-speed SPMs can substantially impact the throughput of a wide range of emerging nanosciences and nanotechnologies. In particular, inversion-based control can find the feedforward input needed to account for the positioning dynamics and, thus, achieve the required precision and bandwidth. This article reviews inversion-based feedforward approaches used for high-speed SPMs such as optimal inversion that accounts for model uncertainty and inversion-based iterative control for repetitive applications. The article establishes connections to other existing methods such as zero-phase-error-tracking feedforward and robust feedforward. Additionally, the article reviews the use of feedforward in emerging applications such as SPM-based nanoscale combinatorial-science studies, image-based control for subnanometer-scale studies, and imaging of large soft biosamples with SPMs.},

The process involves the extraction of the individual right Kronecker blocks of the pencil, accomplished entirely with unitary transformations. In particular, when adding one new output, i.e., appending a single row, the maximum number of new zeroes that can be placed is exactly the largest right Kronecker index.},

The proposed sequential design method enables the retention of some stable open-loop poles and the associated eigenvectors in the closed-loop system, and it allows some optimal closed-loop poles to be placed in a specific region of the complex plane, by sequentially assigning some virtual finite open-loop zeros. Moreover, it provides a design procedure for determining the weighting matrices and linear quadratic state regulators for optimal control of multivariable systems in the frequency domain. The selection of the state weighting matrix, via the proposed method, places emphasis on specific linear combinations of the states (of the designers choice), rather than prespecified linear combinations of the states (output) which often arise in practical applications. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<>},

abstract = {Industrial implementation of model-based control methods, such as model predictive control, is often complicated by the lack of knowledge about the disturbances entering the system. In this paper, we present a new method (constrained ALS) to estimate the variances of the disturbances entering the process using routine operating data. A variety of methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Of note, we compare \{ALS\} to the classic approach presented in Mehra [(1970). On the identification of variances and adaptive Kalman filtering. \{IEEE\} Transactions on Automatic Control, 15(12), 175–184]. This classic method, and those based on it, use a three-step procedure to compute the covariances. The method presented in this paper is a one-step procedure, which yields covariance estimates with lower variance on all examples tested. The formulation used in this paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the estimated covariances, previously not available in the literature. We show that the estimated covariances are unbiased and converge to the true values with increasing sample size. The proposed method also guarantees positive semidefinite covariance estimates by adding constraints to the \{ALS\} problem. The resulting convex program can be solved efficiently. },

abstract={Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool that can perform nano-scale imaging. Normally AFM tip is controlled to scan on sample surface line by line to get the topographic image and this process takes several minutes. Higher sample rate is demanded so that when doing continuous imaging, the time interval between each image can be significantly shorted thus video-imaging can be achieved. In this paper, a compressive sensing based AFM video-imaging system is built, and random walk based scanning path is proposed. Compressive sensing requires random sampling. Bio-inspired random walk based scan path is able to provide a random tip moving path, which enables compressive sensing to be implemented into AFM scanning system. Experiments based on this system are set up in order to test the performance. It first raster scan the entire area and then generate a biased random tip moving path focusing on some specific areas. Compressive scan is then used to continuously scan the sample surface. Finally, video-imaging is achieved and dynamic changes in nano-scale are observed.},

    abstract = { In this paper, we develop a new control method that brings together the advantages of fuzzy logic and sliding mode control. First, we introduce a non-chattering robust sliding mode control. Then, in order to improve the performance of the controller a fuzzy logic algorithm is integrated with the sliding mode controller. This algorithm decides the slope of the sliding surface of the sliding mode controller dynamically. Thus, the system is caught on the sliding surface rapidly and remains over it, more successfully improving the performance of the controller. Afterwards, to test the success of the controller introduced, it is applied to a planar robot, which is to follow a certain trajectory only using the control inputs produced. The results are compared with those of a conventional PID controlled system and a sliding mode controller with constant surface slope. In order to check the robust behavior of the controller designed, an unexpected change in the mass of the second link is introduced and to make the conditions tougher it is assumed that this change is not sensed by the controllers. Noise resistance of the proposed controller is also checked by introducing normally distributed noise components into the equations of motion of the robot model. },

Experimental results for an analog implementation using a bucket brigade device (BBD), as well as a digital implementation, is presented. \{RC\} can provide fast and accurate tracking of periodic reference signals, which is useful in many scanning probe microscopy and nanofabrication applications. },

abstract = {This article compares the imaging performance of non-traditional scanning patterns for scanning probe microscopy including sinusoidal raster, spiral, and Lissajous patterns. The metrics under consideration include the probe velocity, scanning frequency, and required sampling rate. The probe velocity is investigated in detail as this quantity is proportional to the required bandwidth of the vertical feedback loop and has a major impact on image quality. By considering a sample with an impulsive Fourier transform, the effect of scanning trajectories on imaging quality can be observed and quantified. The non-linear trajectories are found to spread the topography signal bandwidth which has important implications for both low and high-speed imaging. These effects are studied analytically and demonstrated experimentally with a periodic calibration grating. },

abstract = {The connections between optimization and control theory have been explored by many researchers and optimization algorithms have been applied with success to optimal control. The rapid pace of developments in model predictive control has given rise to a host of new problems to which optimization has yet to be applied. Concurrently, developments in optimization, and especially in interior-point methods, have produced a new set of algorithms that may be especially helpful in this context. In this paper, we reexamine the relatively simple problem of control of linear processes subject to quadratic objectives and general linear constraints. We show how new algorithms for quadratic programming can be applied efficiently to this problem. The approach extends to several more general problems in straightforward ways.},

In this paper, a novel digital charge amplifier is presented. Results show that hysteresis is reduced by 91 compared with a voltage amplifier, but over long operational periods the digital charge amplifier approach suffers displacement drift. A non-linear ARX model with long-term accuracy is used with a data fusion algorithm to remove the drift. Experimental results are presented.},

  abstract={A physics-based fractional-order Maxwell resistive capacitor (FOMRC) model is proposed to characterize nonlinear hysteresis and creep behaviors of a piezoelectric actuator (PEA). The Maxwell resistive capacitor (MRC) model is interpreted physically in the electric domain for PEAs. Based on this interpretation, the MRC model is modified to directly describe the relationship between the input voltage and the output displacement of a PEA. Then a procedure is developed to identify the parameters of the MRC model. This procedure is capable of being carried out using the measured input and output of a PEA only. A fractional-order dynamics is integrated into the MRC model to describe the effect of creep, as well as the detachment of hysteresis loops caused by creep. Moreover, the inverse FOMRC model is constructed to compensate for hysteresis and creep in an open-loop positioning application of PEAs. Simulation and experiments are carried out to validate the proposed model. The PEA compensated by the inverse FOMRC model shows an excellent linear behavior.},

abstract = {Abstract Intrinsically disordered (ID) regions of proteins are recognized to be involved in biological processes such as transcription, translation, and cellular signal transduction. Despite the important roles of ID regions, effective methods to observe these thin and flexible structures directly were not available. Herein, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe the heterodimeric FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) protein, which is predicted to have large ID regions in each subunit. Successive AFM images of FACT on a mica surface, captured at rates of 5–17 frames per second, clearly reveal two distinct tail-like segments that protrude from the main body of FACT and fluctuate in position. Using deletion mutants of FACT, we identify these tail segments as the two major ID regions predicted from the amino acid sequences. Their mechanical properties estimated from the AFM images suggest that they have more relaxed structures than random coils. These observations demonstrate that this state-of-the-art microscopy method can be used to characterize unstructured protein segments that are difficult to visualize with other experimental techniques.},

To improve synchronized motion control performance, a cost function was applied to account for dual-stage actuator tracking error as well as tracking error in the first-stage actuator. The dual-stage actuator control system uses repetitive model predictive control with two repetitive controllers to reduce the occurrence of periodic errors. As in precision machining, a complex reference trajectory containing two dynamic tracking signals with non-trivial magnitude and frequency orders in a motor/piezoelectric-driven dual-stage actuator system was used to evaluate the practicability of the proposed repetitive model predictive control method. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed repetitive model predictive control system in enhancing the periodic tracking control of dual-stage actuator systems, even when subjected to persistent short pulse disturbance. },

abstract ={Fungal cellobiohydrolases act at liquid-solid interfaces. They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two-domain structure, i.e. cellulose-binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture. However, the details of the action of the two domains on crystalline cellulose are still unclear. Here, we present real time observations of Trichoderma reesei (Tr) cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) molecules sliding on crystalline cellulose, obtained with a high speed atomic force microscope. The average velocity of the sliding movement on crystalline cellulose was 3.5 nm/s, and interestingly, the catalytic domain without the cellulose-binding domain moved with a velocity similar to that of the intact TrCel7A enzyme. However, no sliding of a catalytically inactive enzyme (mutant E212Q) or a variant lacking tryptophan at the entrance of the active site tunnel (mutant W40A) could be detected. This indicates that, besides the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, the loading of a cellulose chain into the active site tunnel is also essential for the enzyme movement.},

  abstract={Frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM; also called non-contact atomic force microscopy) is the prevailing operation mode in (sub-)atomic resolution vacuum applications. A major obstacle that prohibits a wider application range is the low frame capture rate. The speed of FM-AFM is limited by the low bandwidth of the automatic gain control (AGC) and frequency demodulation loops. In this work we describe a novel algorithm that can be used to overcome these weaknesses. We analysed the settling times of the proposed loops and that of the complete system, and we found that an approximately 70-fold improvement can be achieved over the existing real and virtual atomic force microscopes. We show that proportional–integral–differential controllers perform better in the frequency demodulation loop than conventional proportional–integral controllers. We demonstrate that the signal to noise ratio of the proposed system is 5.7 × 10 −5 , which agrees with that of the conventional systems; thus, the new algorithm would improve the performance of FM-AFMs without compromising the resolution.},

abstract = {Frequency response function (FRF) estimation is widely used for system identification and related applications, such as model updating and structural health monitoring. Whether estimated from data or from a finite element (FE) model, there is uncertainty involved that introduces variability in the FRF evaluation, which leads to misinterpretation of system identification results or false alarms (Type-I error) if used in hypothesis testing for damage detection. This paper aims to quantify the uncertainty of FRF estimated with randomly-excited experimental data using the H1 estimator, for both its magnitude and phase. A Gaussian bivariate statistical model is implemented, and probability density functions (PDF) of the magnitude and phase estimations are derived. The proposed statistical model is validated for both an ideal simulation test-bed and an experimental lab-scale structure. To further validate the model's robustness, artificial noise is added to contaminate the original data. The predicted PDFs show a very good match with histogram observations, where outlier percentage is selected as the comparison metric in this paper. For different significance levels, the outlier percentages all consistently agree with the pre-described uncertainty thresholds, indicating that the proposed statistical model suitably quantifies the uncertainty of FRF estimations using H1.},

abstract = {We study the notion of compressed sensing (CS) as put forward by Donoho, Candes, Tao and others. The notion proposes a signal or image, unknown but supposed to be compressible by a known transform, (e.g. wavelet or Fourier), can be subjected to fewer measurements than the nominal number of data points, and yet be accurately reconstructed. The samples are nonadaptive and measure ‘random’ linear combinations of the transform coefficients. Approximate reconstruction is obtained by solving for the transform coefficients consistent with measured data and having the smallest possible ℓ1 norm. We present initial ‘proof-of-concept’ examples in the favorable case where the vast majority of the transform coefficients are zero. We continue with a series of numerical experiments, for the setting of ℓp-sparsity, in which the object has all coefficients nonzero, but the coefficients obey an ℓp bound, for some p∈(0,1]. The reconstruction errors obey the inequalities paralleling the theory, seemingly with well-behaved constants. We report that several workable families of ‘random’ linear combinations all behave equivalently, including random spherical, random signs, partial Fourier and partial Hadamard. We next consider how these ideas can be used to model problems in spectroscopy and image processing, and in synthetic examples see that the reconstructions from CS are often visually “noisy”. To suppress this noise we post-process using translation-invariant denoising, and find the visual appearance considerably improved. We also consider a multiscale deployment of compressed sensing, in which various scales are segregated and CS applied separately to each; this gives much better quality reconstructions than a literal deployment of the CS methodology. These results show that, when appropriately deployed in a favorable setting, the CS framework is able to save significantly over traditional sampling, and there are many useful extensions of the basic idea.},
